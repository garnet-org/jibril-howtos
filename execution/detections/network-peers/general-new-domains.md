# General New Domains

## Quick Explanation

The `general_new_domains` detection recipe identifies access to recently registered domains. Newly registered domains are often used by attackers for malicious activities including phishing, malware distribution, command and control communications, and fraud operations. This detection helps identify potential threats before they become widely known or blocked by traditional security measures.

## More Information

### Information

**Description**: Access to recently registered domains\
**Tactic**: [Exfiltration](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0010)\
**Technique**: [Automated Exfiltration](https://jibril.garnet.ai/mitre/mitre/ta0010/t1041)\
**Importance**: Critical

### Analysis of the Event

The detection of access to recently registered domains represents a significant security concern as attackers frequently leverage newly created domains to evade reputation-based security controls and domain blacklists. Fresh domains provide attackers with clean reputations, making them effective for initial attack vectors such as phishing campaigns, malware distribution, or establishing command and control infrastructure.

This detection aligns with MITRE ATT\&CK framework techniques across multiple tactics including Initial Access (T1566 - Phishing), Command and Control (T1071 - Application Layer Protocol), and Exfiltration (T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel). Cybercriminals and advanced persistent threat groups routinely register domains just before launching campaigns, using them briefly before abandoning them to avoid detection and attribution.

### Implications

#### Implications for CI/CD Pipelines

The detection of recently registered domain access within CI/CD environments poses several risks:

* **Supply Chain Attacks**: Attackers may use newly registered domains to host malicious packages, compromised dependencies, or fraudulent software repositories that infiltrate the build process.
* **Code Repository Compromise**: Fresh domains could serve as hosting platforms for malicious code injection attacks, compromised mirrors of legitimate repositories, or fake package registries.
* **Credential Harvesting**: Newly registered domains mimicking legitimate development tools, version control systems, or CI/CD platforms may be used to steal developer credentials and access tokens.

#### Implications for Staging

In staging environments, access to recently registered domains indicates potential threats such as:

* **Testing Data Exfiltration**: Attackers may use fresh domains to establish covert channels for extracting sensitive test data, configuration files, or pre-production code from staging environments.
* **Reconnaissance Operations**: Newly registered domains could serve as collection points for intelligence gathering about staging infrastructure, security controls, and deployment processes.
* **Malware Staging**: Fresh domains may host malware payloads designed to compromise staging systems and establish persistence for future production attacks.

#### Implications for Production

In production environments, recently registered domain access represents critical security concerns:

* **Active Threat Campaigns**: Fresh domains are commonly used in active phishing, malware, or fraud campaigns targeting customers, employees, or business partners.
* **Data Exfiltration Channels**: Newly registered domains may serve as command and control infrastructure for data theft operations, providing attackers with clean communication channels.
* **Brand Impersonation**: Attackers often register domains that closely mimic legitimate business domains to conduct fraud, phishing, or reputation damage campaigns.

### Recommended Actions

#### Actions for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Dependency Source Verification**: Immediately audit all package sources, repositories, and external dependencies accessed during the build process to ensure they originate from trusted, established domains.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Analyze network logs to identify the specific recently registered domains accessed and determine the nature of the communications or data transfers.
3. **Build Artifact Security Scanning**: Perform comprehensive security scans on all artifacts produced during builds that may have interacted with newly registered domains.
4. **Pipeline Network Restrictions**: Implement network policies that restrict pipeline environments from accessing domains registered within a specified timeframe unless explicitly whitelisted.

#### Actions for Staging

1. **Domain Reputation Assessment**: Conduct thorough assessments of the newly registered domains accessed, including WHOIS analysis, content examination, and threat intelligence correlation.
2. **Environment Isolation Review**: Strengthen network segmentation between staging and production environments to prevent potential lateral movement from compromised staging systems.
3. **Security Monitoring Enhancement**: Increase monitoring sensitivity for suspicious network activities, data transfers, or system behaviors that may indicate compromise via newly registered domains.
4. **Incident Response Preparation**: Prepare incident response procedures specifically for scenarios involving newly registered domain interactions and potential data exfiltration.

#### Actions for Production

1. **Emergency Threat Assessment**: Immediately conduct comprehensive threat assessments to determine if the newly registered domain access indicates an active attack campaign or security incident.
2. **Customer Protection Measures**: Implement protective measures to safeguard customers from potential phishing, fraud, or malware campaigns associated with the detected domains.
3. **Brand Monitoring Activation**: Activate enhanced brand monitoring capabilities to identify potential domain squatting, typosquatting, or impersonation attempts using newly registered domains.
4. **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integrate findings with threat intelligence platforms to contribute to broader security community knowledge and receive alerts about related malicious domains.
